These two files provide functions to manipulate an image in various ways. The first, imageManip.js, uses loops to 
iterate over the 2D array of the image. It provides four functions: removeBlueAndGreen, which makes the image red
by removing blue and green values, makeGrayscale which makes the image grayscale, highlightEdges which creates a
black-and-white version of the image where the edges are highlighted, and blur which blurs the image. 
higherOrder.js uses higherOrder functions for more optimal code. The two functions added are imageMask, which 
creates red lines over the image, and lightenAndDarken which increases contrast in the image by lightening
lighter areas of the images and darkening dark ones.
